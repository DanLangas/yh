# yh - YAML Highlighter

Dummy YAML syntax highlighter to bring colours where only jq could.

This project starts with the author's incapacity to give up on seeing colours while playing with kubernetes (kubectl) command line as would instead happen using JSON output. Unable to find a simple YAML highlighter where he could just pipe some content with little expectations, he decided to write one as an excuse for some Go training.
