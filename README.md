# yh - YAML Highlighter

Dummy YAML syntax highlighter to bring colours where only jq could.

A bit of history.

This project starts with the author's incapacity to give up on seeing colours while playing with kubernetes (kubectl) command line and YAML output (-o yaml) as would instead happen using JSON output.

Unable to find a simple YAML highlighter where he could just pipe some content with little to none expectations, he decided to write one as an excuse for some Go training.
