# yh - YAML Highlighter

Dummy YAML syntax highlighter to bring colours where only jq could.

This project starts as a go training use case and the need of the author to see colours any time he runs kubectl commands with -o yaml. Unable to find a simple YAML highlighter where he could just pipe some content with little expectations, he decided to write one.
